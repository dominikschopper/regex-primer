			<h1>Regex Primer</h1>

			<p>this is a primer for regex (=regular expressions) and their testing<br/>
				this is not a complete course or something, just my basic notes on regexes, so i can just work through the main points - if i have to explain stuff to someone<br />
				use at own risk! </p>

			

			<h2 id="jump-regex-intro">Regex Intro</h2>

				<p>regular expressione or regex for short are a way to define search patterns for searching and replacing texts</p>

				<p>regex is some kind of a language on its own and has - unfortunately - several dialects that are somewhat alike but not really compatible</p>

				<p>most development editors or IDEs provide a way to work with regexes and a lot of command line tools do it too, plus all programming languages
					i know support it in some dialect ... <br/>
					tools: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/">grep</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/">sed</a>, 
						<a target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/">awk</a>, ...<br/>
					editors/IDEs: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">sublime</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://netbeans.org/">Netbeans</a>,
					<a target="_blank" href="https://eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vim.org/docs.php">vi</a>, ...<br/>
					languages: perl, javascript, php, ...
				</p>

				<p class="attention">A regex is used to match lines, so this is why in lots of programms the regex never matches an end of line.
					Some editors though do not stick to that rule. Languages like e.g. Perl do have regex switches, that can be used to make a pattern match multiline
					(otherwise the comparison would be stopped at <code>\n</code>).</p>

				<p>best to stick to one tool first and get to know ist quirks and specialities, you can later easily adapt to another dialect for another tool</p>

			
			
			<h3>Before we start</h3>

				<p>regexes are a search (and replace) language or - as it is often called - a pattern matching language</p>

				<p class="attention">
					regexes are character based, that means all parts of a search pattern are referencing a space where one character can be placed.
					there are <a href="#jump-quantifiers">quantifiers</a> and <a href="#jump-anchors">anchors</a> that show how often something can be repeated, or where
					something is, but basically your building blocks of a pattern describe, what is in the place of a single character.
				</p>

				<p>each example will have a <strong>regex</strong> and an input part (often with several lines)
				lines will be searched seperately as it is with the famous grep command line tool, so we will consider which line will be found or what will be replaced there</p>

				<p>please remember, that the main character to mask or mark something in the regex is the <code>\</code> so we will see a lot of those!<br />
					<strong>plus</strong> some languages (perl, javascript, php often too) do have the habit of marking beginning and end of regexes with the <code>/</code><br/>
					this plus all of the other special characters and stuff are the reasons, why regex is often considered to be <strong>write only</strong> code ("leaning toothpick syndrome"), so please, document, what your regex means!<br/>
					all too often i cannot see what a regex means that  i wrote after some days!</p> 


			<h2 id="jump-simple-patterns">Simple Patterns</h2>

				<p>if you want to find any line, that contains an <strong>x</strong> you can just search it like this <code>x</code></p>

				<p>same with words, you search vor <strong>joe</strong>, the search term is <code>joe</code> and this will find:</p>

				<p>each line that contains the three letters <code>j</code> <code>o</code> and <code>e</code> one after the other<br />
					this seems simple, but understand: a regex consists mainly of symbols for one character
				</p>

				<p>regexes always search case sensitive, normally there is a modifier to make the search case insensitive</p>

				<p>regexes (in most programming languages i know) normally only search for the ocurrence of a pattern (the first ocurrance), if you want to <em>search</em>
					for all ocurrences you have to provide a modifier to do that (most editors do not behave like that)<br/>
					this modifier often is named <code>g</code> for <strong>global</strong> search, which means <strong>global</strong>
					(as in everywhere) on the <strong>same line</strong>
				</p>

				<p>each section or exercise will have a part like the one below, where you can test the input against some given data<br/>
					every time you click on the <button class="pure-button">apply</button> the text that is matched by the given regex is marked</p>

						<pre id="input-01" class="regex-input">When HTML is used to create interactive sites, care needs to
be taken to avoid introducing vulnerabilities through which attackers can compromise the
integrity of the site itself or of the site's users.
A comprehensive study of this matter is beyond the scope of this document, and authors
are strongly encouraged to study the matter in more detail. However, this section attempts
to provide a quick introduction to some common pitfalls in HTML application development.
The security model of the Web is based on the concept of "origins", and correspondingly
many of the potential attacks on the Web involve cross-origin actions.</pre>
					</div>
				</fieldset>
			</form>



			<h2 id="jump-classes">Character Classes</h2>

				<p>we cannot only search for fixed strings/literals but we can create a bit complexer patterns with classes</p>

				<p>a class represents one single character out of a group (or you can think of as chaining seperate characters with <strong>or</strong>, that can occur
					in a single space)</p>

				<p class="attention">
					a class is like this <code>[aeiou]</code>, the square brackets mark the class, everything in between is what will be searched for, here it is 
					all vocals.<br/>
					this means the class above searches for one character out of <code>a</code> or <code>e</code> or <code>i</code> <br/>
					classes can be negated, so anything but an <strong>a</strong> could be constructed like so <code>[^a]</code> in some dialects also <code>[!a]</code><br/>
					class contents can be written like this: <code>[01234567]</code> which would match a single character that is a numbers between <strong>0</strong> and
					<strong>9</strong> or it could be shortened like that <code>[0-7]</code>
				</p>


				<h3>Edge Cases</h3>

				<p>and here comes the question, how can i put the simple dash - into a group, and not as the "range" opreator of the class?
				simple just use it as first or last character in the class definition or escape it with the backslash.
				so the class that would match one of these single characters a b c d or the - could be written as <code>[a-d-]</code> <code>[-a-d]</code>
				<code>[a-c\-d]</code></p>

				<p>if you want to search for e.g. a square bracket, you'll have to use <code>\[</code> or <code>\]</code> respectively inside the brackets</p>

				<p>the most common and variable class definiton is described with square brackets e.g. a single <code>d</code> <strong>or</strong> a single <code>t</code> could be constructed like so <code>pre[dt]</code></p>
				<p>
					so this regex means:<br/>
					a <code>p</code> followed by a <code>r</code> followed by a <code>e</code> then either a <code>d</code> or a <code>t</code>
				</p>

				<h3>Trial</h3>

						<pre id="input-02" class="regex-input">Bataille's analysis of predialectic objectivism holds
that culture is used in the service of archaic, sexist perceptions

If capitalist objectivism holds, we have to choose between predialectic
objectivism and Lacanist obscurity.</pre>

			<h3>predefined classes</h3>

			<p>this depends on the programm providing the regex, but most editors etc. provide some predefined classes for</p>

			<dl>
				<dt><code>.</code></dt>
				<dd>any character at all doesnt matter what: <code>.</code> very important</dd>
				
				<dt><code>\d</code></dt>
				<dd>Numbers/Decimals: <code>[0123456789]</code> or shorter <code>[0-9]</code> or predefined <code>\d</code></dd>
				
				<dt><code>\D</code></dt>
				<dd>Not a number: <code>[^0-9]</code> or predefined <code>\D</code></dd>
				
				<dt><code>\w</code></dt>
				<dd>Word characters: <code>[A-Za-z0-9_]</code> would be <code>\w</code></dd>
				
				<dt><code>\W</code></dt>
				<dd>Not a word character: <code>[^A-Za-z0-9_]</code> would be <code>\W</code></dd>
				
				<dt><code>\s</code></dt>
				<dd>Whitespace: <code>[ \t\v\r\n\f]</code> would be <code>\s</code> (\v being a vertical tab, never encountered one, but it should be whitespace according to documentation ;) \f is formfeed ... ditto)</dd>
				
				<dt><code>\S</code></dt>
				<dd>Not a whitespace: <code>[^ \t\v\r\n]</code> would be <code>\S</code></dd>
			</dl>



			<h2 id="jump-quantifiers">Quantifiers</h2>

			<p>a quantifier is yet another special character in the regex zoo and tells us how often a character (or class) may occur.</p>

			<p>the most variable quantifier is written in curly braces so three times the letter p could be written as p{3}</p>

			<p>to make things more interesting, we can also write two numbers in curly braces to specify an at least to a max number of ocurrences</p>

			<p>e.g. <code>m{1,2}</code> is one or two m so it would match</p>

			<p>or <code>a{0,1}</code> is an aor no a</p>

			<p>or <code>a{1,}</code> means at least 1 a up to as many as you like so it would match <code>K<span class="re-match">a</span>n<span class="re-match">aa</span>n</code> or even <code><span class="re-match">aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</span>hhh!!!</code></p>

			<h3>predefined quantifiers</h3>

			<dl>
				<dt><code>?</code></dt>
				<dd>
					0 to 1 characters would be <code>{0,1}</code> and can be written as <code>?</code><br />
					example <code>https?://</code> would match the following urls
					<pre class="regex-input"><span class="re-match">http://</span>www.wotever.com
<span class="re-match">https://</span>domain.com/ssl</pre>
				</dd>
				
				<dt><code>*</code></dt>
				<dd>0 to as many as possible characters would be <code>{0,}</code> and can be written as <code>*</code><br />
										example <code>"[^"]*"</code> would globally match the following parts of a csv
<pre class="regex-input">
<span class="re-match">""</span>;<span class="re-match">"ID"</span>;<span class="re-match">"fname"</span>;<span class="re-match">"lname"</span><br />
<span class="re-match">"0"</span>;<span class="re-match">"Thomas"</span>;<span class="re-match">"Greene"</span><br />
<span class="re-match">"1"</span>;<span class="re-match">""</span>;<span class="re-match">"Miller"</span><br />
<span class="re-match">"2"</span>;<span class="re-match">"Kim"</span>;<span class="re-match">""</span></pre>
					<p class="attention">
						The <code>*</code> in RegEx is quite close to the <code class="shell-pattern">*</code> in Shell filename matching,
						but has to be interpreted slightly differently. dont mix these things<br/>
						the shell <code class="shell-pattern">*</code> can be used as 0-max characters, the same thing as regex would be
						<code>.*</code> in a regex, The regex <code>*</code> cannot be used standalone!
					</p>
				</dd>
				
				<dt><code>+</code></dt>
				<dd>
					1 to as many as possible characters would be <code>{1,}</code> and can be written as <code>+</code><br />
					so the example above <code>a{1,}</code> could be written as <code>a+</code>
				</dd>
			</dl>
			
			<h3>Greediness</h3>

			<p>Attention!</p>
			<p>RegEx quantifiers are per se greedy that means they always match as many characters as possible!</p>

			<p>given the input string
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Obcaecati saepe laboriosam expedita blandi
and the pattern /m.*/ the pattern would match all of that
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Obcaecati saepe laboriosam expedita blandi
this is especially important for any search and replace!</p>
